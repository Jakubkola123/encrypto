                    <h3>Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Goes Live, Unlocking $34 Billion in Staked ETH</h3>
                    <p>At 6:27 pm EST, Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade was successfully implemented, enabling
                        the withdrawal of staked ETH and effectively finalizing the network’s years-long transition to proof of stake. 
                        Last September, Ethereum successfully executed its highly anticipated merge event, forever changing both how ETH
                        is created and how transactions on the Ethereum network are validated. The upgrade saw Ethereum transition to a
                        proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in which users stake ETH with the network to validate on-chain transactions,
                        and are rewarded for that participation with newly generated ETH. Since ETH staking debuted in 2020, participants
                        have deposited over $34.56 billion worth of ETH with the network.

                    <h3>ApeCoin surges 1,950% on South Korean crypto exchange Upbit</h3>
                    <p>
                        On April 12, Yuga Labs' ERC-20 token ApeCoin (APE) briefly surged to $90.00 from around $4.20 apiece on the South Korean
                        cryptocurrency exchange Upbit before most gains were wiped out in a sharp sell-off. However, the token is still trading
                        at $10.90 apiece at the time of publication, representing a significant premium of around $4.50 compared to other exchanges. 
                        Currently, the only APE trading pair listed on Upbit is BTC/APE; it represents only a tiny portion of the coin's trading volume,
                         with around 4 million tokens changing hands during the day compared to APE's overall circulation of 369 million tokens.
                        It appears the spike was attributed to an overall retail frenzy and constriction of available trading routes on the exchange.
                        On the same day, Upbit suspended the deposits and withdrawals of Ether(ETH) and ERC-20 tokens, pending the completion of the
                         Ethereum network's Shanghai upgrade.

                    <h3>S. Korean Crypto Exchange Gdac Hacked for Nearly $13M</h3>
                    <p>
                        South Korean crypto exchange Gdac was hacked for nearly $13 million on Sunday, the firm said on Monday.
                        Hackers transferred nearly $13 million worth of crypto, 23% of its total custodial assets, from Gdac's hot wallet to an unidentified wallet.
                        The hackers stole nearly 61 bitcoins (BTC), 350.5 ether (ETH), 10 million wemix tokens (WEMIX) and 220,000 USDT. Gdac said it has notified
                        the authorities about the hack and is working to recover the funds. Crypto platforms have suffered some notable hacks and exploits in the
                        past 15 to 18 months. The largest was Axie Infinity's Ronin bridge, which suffered a $625 million hack last year. On Sunday,
                        decentralized-finance protocol Sushi was exploited for $3.3 million.
